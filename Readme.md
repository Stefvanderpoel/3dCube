# A 3dCube in HTML5

In this repo I experiment with the transform3d css parameter. I use this example as the basis of the project:
https://3dtransforms.desandro.com/

Very nice and informative about how to work with css 3d transform.

My Objectives:
- try to make the cube movable by user input
- try to project external content on the cube's surface
- Try to make the cube rotatable.
- See if I can make the cube rotatable by clicking on the cube and moving the cursor

The result of the experiments is published at https://3dcube.stefvanderpoel.nl

## Rescript the Javascript

I want to learn how Javascript works so I do not want to use jQuery. The result is that I had to rewrite the Javascript.
